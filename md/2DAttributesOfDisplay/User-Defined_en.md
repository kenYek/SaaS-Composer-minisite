# User-Defined Data Binding
**Usage method:**

User can create an item list of binded data and may apply for the future use on the display.

When sketching on the display, if data binding is necessary, select the userDefined type and then choose a custom name for data binding.

Purpose:
To avoid the tedious operation of frequent selection when multiple data bindings are needed and reduces the possibility of errors in selection.
